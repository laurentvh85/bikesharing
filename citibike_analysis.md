# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

NYC is the United States largest city, and also one of the most densely populated ones. In this analysis I looked at several factors that may be useful in consideration for starting a similar business in Des Moines. I chose to look at the MCD data, gender diversity, and population differences.

## Analysis

I created a tableau story to convey my findings:

In the first slide we get a snapshot of Citibike in NYC. We can see that 2.3M rides were taken in August, starting locations, trip length, and gender breakdown. We can see that the vast majority of rides are done by males, even if we attribute all the unknown sexes, the majority is still men. This is a useful metric for comparison, which I look at in the coming slides. We can see that younger people tend to take longer rides, which leads to more income. The starting locations map shows us that people are more likely to take Citibikes near tourist hot spots, and from popular areas to work (midtown).

In the second slide we can see the peak hours and customer breakdown. It looks like close to 80% of all riders are subscribers vs walk up customers. This leads me to believe that it is mainly local people using the service. This data is from August, which would be peak tourist season. Tourists may not be as important to the business model as we would have thought. We can also see that the bike utilization is most during the peak commuting times both in the morning and evening. We can see from the chart that we should do most of our maintenance overnight when it is the leas busy, and would have the least impact on the system.

I then move on to the demographics of each city to see if there are similarities. I present a graph that shows us the ages of riders. We can see that that vast majority of the rides are taken by people in the 18-65 range. Using the census data, I was able to prepare another graph that shows what percent of the population falls in this category in each city. There is only a 1.6% difference between the two, which i would classify as very similar. I also included the sex differences for each city. NYC has a higher percentage of females, but again the difference is not large enough for it to make a big impact. The higher percentage of men bodes well for Iowa.

In the next slide I look at even more demographics. NYC is almost 39x the population of Des Moines, and it gets almost 5x the amount of tourists. It is also extremely more densely populates, and has a larger land mass. If we go off of the NYC rider data, then the tourist numbers are less relevant, as most riders subscribe on a monthly basis. The high density in NYC means that the likelihood of people using Citibikes will be much higher. Also, the density in Des Moines is so much lower, this means that people are living much further apart, which might mean that bike rides might not make sense to commute.

The weather in both areas is similar, this means we can look at the NYC data and see if there are any patterns that relate to weather.

Both NYC and Des Moines have extensive bike lanes. It seems that Des Moines has many protected and separated lanes from cars, whereas NYC has a lot of shared lanes with cars. If riders feel safer, they are more likely to use a bike.

I also looked at the MCD locations. NYC has relatively few MCD locations compared to Des Moines. They are also much more evenly spread out than in NYC. This makes sense, as Manhattan is an island. I don't think that the locations in NYC have any affect on the Citibike locations as there are unlimited different and better alternatives for food.

Unfortunately we are too late to the game, and a competitor has already cornered the market!!! They only have 120 bikes, so there may be opportunity for competition.

### Conclusion

While having a Citibike version sounds like an interesting investment opportunity, we are simply too late. The demographics are somewhat similar in terms of age and sex, the weather is the same, and there are plenty of bike lanes. I would pass on the opportunity as the market is simply too small. A population of 200,000+ and such low density probably does not make sense. A very important piece of information that we are missing from Citibike is how many unique subscribers it has. Subscribers get an alloted amount of time for free each ride, if they do not go over, then they only collect the monthly/yearly fee. It is irrelevant how many rides get taken a month if the majority are short and by subscribers. If we knew the monthly unique subscriber payments, then we can get a better idea. There are many citibike users that use the bikes 4x+ a day for short journeys that would not incrementally make us any money.
